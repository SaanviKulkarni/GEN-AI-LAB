            "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case that stops the recursion. Think of it like a set of Russian nesting dolls: each doll contains a smaller version of itself.\n",

            "Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Base case**: A function checks if it has reached a point where it can stop calling itself. This is the \"base case\" that ends the recursion.\n",
            "2. **Recursive call**: If the base case is not met, the function calls itself with a smaller input or a modified version of the original input.\n",
            "3. **Repeat steps 1-2**: The function continues to call itself until it reaches the base case.\n",
            "4. **Return value**: When the base case is reached, the function returns a value, which is then used by the previous call to the function, and so on.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Example: Factorial Function**\n",
            "\n",
            "A classic example of recursion is calculating the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a recursive implementation of the factorial function in Python:\n",
            "```python\n",
            "def factorial(n):\n",
            "    if n == 0:  # base case\n",
            "        return 1\n",

            "        return n * factorial(n-1)  # recursive call\n",
            "```\n",
            "In this example, the `factorial` function calls itself with decreasing values of `n` until it reaches the base case (`n == 0`). At that point, the function returns the final result, which is then used by the previous call to calculate the final result.\n",
            "\n",
            "Recursion can be a powerful tool for solving problems that have a recursive structure, but it can also lead to stack overflows if not implemented carefully.\n",

            "\n",
            "Binary search is a way to find a specific item in a list of items. It's like searching for a book in a library. Instead of looking through every book one by one, you can use binary search to find the book in just a few steps.\n",

            "**How Does Binary Search Work?**\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's how it works:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. First, we need to sort the list of items in order. This is like organizing the books on the shelves in alphabetical order.\n",
            "2. Next, we look at the middle item in the list. This is like looking at the book in the middle of the shelf.\n",
            "3. If the item we're looking for is less than the middle item, we know it must be in the first half of the list. So, we repeat the process with just the first half of the list.\n",
            "4. If the item we're looking for is greater than the middle item, we know it must be in the second half of the list. So, we repeat the process with just the second half of the list.\n",
            "5. We keep repeating this process until we find the item we're looking for.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Example:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's say we have a list of numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15\n",
            "\n",
            "We want to find the number 9. Here's how we would use binary search:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. We look at the middle item, which is 7.\n",
            "2. Since 9 is greater than 7, we know it must be in the second half of the list.\n",
            "3. We repeat the process with just the second half of the list: 9, 11, 13, 15\n",
            "4. We look at the middle item, which is 11.\n",
            "5. Since 9 is less than 11, we know it must be in the first half of the list.\n",

            "Binary search is very efficient because it reduces the number of items we need to search through with each step. In this example, we started with 8 items and reduced it to 1 item in just 3 steps. This makes binary search much faster than searching through every item one by one.\n",

            "================ CHAIN OF THOUGHT ================\n",
            "To find the total complexity, we need to consider the time complexity of the function and the number of times it's called.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "If the function is called 'n' times, then the total time complexity would be the sum of the time complexities of each call.\n",

            "- **Access Time**: Arrays allow for random access of elements, meaning you can access any element in constant time (O(1)). Linked Lists, however, require sequential access, which means you have to traverse the list from the beginning to reach a specific element, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).\n",
