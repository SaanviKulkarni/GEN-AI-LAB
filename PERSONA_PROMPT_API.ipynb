            "Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare refer to artificial intelligence systems that can process and analyze vast amounts of medical data, including patient records, clinical notes, and research articles. These models can learn patterns and relationships within the data, enabling them to provide insights and recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and patient care.\n",

            "- Clinical decision support systems that aid doctors in diagnosing and treating patients.\n",
            "- Medical literature analysis and summarization, which helps researchers and clinicians stay up-to-date with the latest research.\n",
            "- Patient engagement and education, where LLMs can provide personalized health information and advice to patients.\n",

            "The benefits of LLMs in healthcare include improved accuracy and speed in diagnosis, enhanced patient engagement, and more efficient clinical workflows. However, LLMs also have limitations, such as the need for high-quality training data, the risk of bias and errors, and the potential for over-reliance on technology.\n",
